# ICP minimal installation on Google Cloud - Terraform Template

This Terraform template deploys on Google Cloud the [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/) version 3.2.1 in a minimal configuration, using the ICP 3.2.1 CE binaries from Docker Hub. 


## Deployment overview
This template creates an environment where
 - The ICP cluster is deployed on a private network and VMs are accessed on public IP using a [NAT Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview)
 - There are no load balancers, but applications can be accessed via the public IP of master node
 - Most ICP services are disabled (they can be activated using the `List of disabled management services` property list available on deploy)
 - Minimal VM sizes ( the size can be changes at deployment time )
 - No separate boot node
 - One Master node only. The Master node has also the role of the Boot node so only one Master vm can be deployed in this configuration.
 - No Vulnerability Advisor node and vulnerability advisor service disabled by default
 - The number of the Management and Worker nodes can be specified at deployment time.
 Note : If the number of Management, Worker and Proxy are set to zero, the Master vm will take the role of the Worker, Management and Proxy node respectively.
 - You cannot deploy more than one Proxy node since there is no load balancer defined.

## Pre-requisites

* The template has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.  RHEL is not supported in this version.

#### Security Groups

The automation leverages Security Groups to lock down public and private access to the cluster.

- SSH is allowed to all cluster nodes to ease exploration and investigation
- UDP and TCP port 30000 - 32767 are allowed on proxy node to enable use of [NodePort](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.0/manage_applications/expose_app.html)
- Inbound communication to the master node is permitted on [ports relevant to the ICP service](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.0/supported_system_config/required_ports.html)
- All outbound communication is allowed.
- All other communication is only permitted between cluster nodes.
